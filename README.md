### TODOs
1. ~~Functional event emit modal~~
1. ~~Add events and socket.io URL to page URL so that it can be shared with set inputs~~
1. ~~Add toggle button to stringify or not to stringify data while emitting~~
1. ~~Store history of emits - and can be re-sent in just one click~~
1. ~~Change timestamps to better formatted time~~
1. Fix URL hashes - if the has only has url value, initiate the app with the connected URL, and no extra event should be added
1. Show socket.id somewhere in the UI (easy to copy)
1. Helper links/buttons to add basic socketio evnets like reconnect, etc.
1. Page titles should show the socket.io connection urls
1. ~~Clear button on panels~~
1. Emit buttons on panel headers - which will prefill the emit form's message input field
